# Eventual consistency

Teacher talked about that besides de other differences, one difference in relation to SQL databases is related to consistency. Imagine a RDBMS relational traditional SQL server cluster. When a new information need to be replicated, it needs to be replicated in time it is be inserted and in a NoSQL world this is not a constraint. Maybe when you get an information, maybe this information is different in another server because it was not replicated yet. This is called eventual consistency.
